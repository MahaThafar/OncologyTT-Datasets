we queried HumanMine (https ://www.humanmine.org, a database of human biological data based on the InterMine platform) for human protein-coding genes. The code is provided in python jupyter notebook format.


## Generate negative samples for OncoDTR method:
> to retrieve negative samples (non-target genes) for each cancer type,
"""
we used the pool of more than 18,000 genes after excluding all positive genes (see https://github.com/MahaThafar/Oncology-Drug-Target-Database/blob/main/all_over_regulate_genes/) 
and extracted te same number of the positive genes
